# Student Management System (C++)

## 📌 Project Overview
This **Student Management System** is a simple yet efficient **console-based C++ application** that helps manage student records. It was developed as part of my **first semester final project** for **Programming Fundamentals**.

The program allows users to **add, search, display, and delete student records** while ensuring data persistence through **file handling**. The project focuses on applying core C++ concepts like **structures, functions, loops, vectors, and file handling**.

## 🛠️ Features
✅ **Add Student** – Input student details (name, roll number, department, semester, marks, CGPA, contact, and address).  
✅ **Search Student** – Find a student by their roll number.  
✅ **Display All Students** – View a list of all stored students with complete details.  
✅ **Delete Student** – Remove a student’s record from the database.  
✅ **File Handling** – Data is stored in a text file (`students.txt`) to ensure persistence.  
✅ **Input Validation** – Prevents incorrect data entry (marks & CGPA range check, proper contact format, etc.).  

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++  
- **Concepts Applied:** File Handling, Structures, Functions, Loops, Vectors, Input Validation  
- **IDE Used:** Any C++ compiler (CodeBlocks, Dev-C++, VS Code, etc.)
